## Performance Optimization

### Core Performance Strategies
- **Launch Optimization**: LaunchOptimizer minimizes main thread blocking during app startup
- **Efficient HealthKit Queries**: Appropriate limits and background processing for health data
- **Caching Strategy**: CacheManager with in-memory and disk caching for offline operation
- **Lazy Loading**: UI components and data loaded on-demand for better responsiveness
- **Memory-Efficient Structures**: Value types (structs) preferred over reference types
- **Background Task Management**: Structured async/await and Task-based concurrency

### Algorithm Optimization
- **Efficient Impact Calculations**: Optimized algorithms for health metric processing
- **Interaction Effect Processing**: Advanced scaling with performance considerations
- **Chart Data Processing**: Efficient data transformation for visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: Optimized data flow for live health metric updates

### UI Performance
- **Glass Theme Optimization**: Efficient Material blur effects and transparency
- **Battery Animation Performance**: Smooth animations without blocking main thread
- **3D Transformation Optimization**: Performance-optimized visual effects
- **SwiftUI Performance**: Proper state management to prevent unnecessary recomputations

### Scalability Considerations
- **Feature Flag System**: Gradual rollout to manage server load
- **Analytics Optimization**: Privacy-respecting data collection with minimal overhead
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Reduced server dependency for better user experience
- **Modular Architecture**: Independent components for easier scaling and maintenance
