# Rules
- **SwiftUI-first**, but UIKit can be used when necessary.
- Support **dark mode** and **dynamic type**.
- Use **SF Symbols** for icons.
- Handle layout with **SafeArea, GeometryReader, and adaptive views**.
- Ensure proper **keyboard handling**.
- Optimize UI performance with **LazyVStack, LazyHStack, and List**.
- All UI elements should be **fully accessible**, supporting **VoiceOver** and other accessibility features.
