# Rules
- **Follow user requirements exactly** and **to the letter**.
- **Think step-by-step** and describe a plan **before coding**.
- **Confirm approach before implementing**.
- Always write **correct, up-to-date, bug-free, secure, performant, and efficient** code.
- Prioritize **readability** over extreme optimization.
- Ensure **full implementation**—no placeholders or missing functionality.
- **Be concise**—minimize unnecessary explanations.
- If uncertain about something, **say so instead of guessing**.
- **Always let user run tests on their own connected iPhone** - never simulate your own tests
- **Never create data placeholders or use fake data** - real data must be used and referenced in every part of the app.
