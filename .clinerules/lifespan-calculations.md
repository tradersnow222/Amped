# Lifespan Calculations Rules

This file documents all calculation logic related to health metrics, lifespan impact, and projections in the Amped iOS app.

## Recent Fixes (2024)

### Phase 5: Fixed Daily Targets Implementation (MAJOR UPDATE)

**Problem Solved:**
- ❌ **Dynamic Target Shifting** → ✅ Fixed daily targets that remain consistent throughout the day
- ❌ **User Confusion** ("Why did my target change?") → ✅ Predictable arithmetic users can trust
- ❌ **Mathematical Precision Over User Psychology** → ✅ User-friendly targets that encourage adherence

**Core Change:**
**Fixed Daily Targets**: Calculate targets once per day, cache them, and use simple arithmetic for remaining amounts throughout the day.

**Examples of the Fix:**
- **Before (Dynamic)**: At 2,037 steps → "Walk 7,920 more steps"; At 2,350 steps → "Walk 6,684 more steps" (target shifted by 923 steps)
- **After (Fixed)**: At 2,037 steps → "Walk 7,920 more steps"; At 2,350 steps → "Walk 7,607 more steps" (consistent 9,957 total target)

**Implementation Details:**
- **Daily Target Caching**: Targets calculated once and cached for the entire day
- **Simple Arithmetic**: Remaining = Fixed Target - Current Value
- **All Metrics**: Applied to steps, exercise, sleep, and all other recommendation types
- **Period Support**: Separate fixed targets for Day, Month, and Year periods
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired targets cleared automatically

**Files Created:**
- `Amped/Core/Models/DailyTarget.swift`: New model for fixed daily targets with caching support

**Files Modified:**
- `Amped/Features/UI/RecommendationService.swift`: Complete overhaul to use fixed targets
- `.cursor/rules/lifespan-calculations.mdc`: Updated documentation
- `.clinerules/lifespan-calculations.md`: Updated documentation

**Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ **User Trust**: Consistent targets that behave predictably
- ✅ **Better Adherence**: Users can track progress against fixed goals
- ✅ **Reduced Confusion**: No more unexplained target changes
- ✅ **Scientific Accuracy**: Initial targets still based on J-curve research
- ✅ **Performance**: Cached targets reduce complex recalculations

### Phase 4: Recommendation Text & Logic Consistency Fix

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ **Inconsistent Text Formatting** → ✅ All recommendations now end with "to add X to your life"
- ❌ **Confusing Period Logic** → ✅ Daily shows additional needed, Month/Year shows total daily targets
- ❌ **Mixed Recommendation Patterns** → ✅ Consistent format across all metric types

**Text Improvements:**
- **Year Recommendations**: Changed from "this year" to "this next year to add X to your life"
- **Month Recommendations**: Changed from "this month" to "this month to add X to your life" 
- **Consistent Endings**: All recommendations now clearly state the life benefit

**Logic Improvements:**
- **Daily Period**: Shows additional amount needed (e.g., "Walk 4,143 more steps today")
- **Month/Year Period**: Shows total daily target (e.g., "Walk 8,743 steps daily this next year")
- **Steps Logic**: For sustained periods, users get total daily step target instead of additional steps
- **Exercise Logic**: Same pattern - additional for daily, total target for month/year
- **Sleep Logic**: Additional hours for daily, total sleep target for sustained periods

**Examples of Fixed Recommendations:**
- Before: "Walk 4,859 steps daily to add 15.0 days this year"
- After: "Walk 8,743 steps daily this next year to add 15.0 days to your life"

**Files Modified:**
- `Amped/Features/UI/RecommendationService.swift`: Updated all recommendation functions for consistency

### Phase 3: Recommendation System Truth Fix

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ **Artificial Caps on Recommendations** → ✅ Show actual action needed to reach neutral
- ❌ **Misleading Benefits** → ✅ Show true benefit of reaching 0 impact
- ❌ **Hardcoded Limits** → ✅ Dynamic calculations based on actual deficit

**Root Cause:**
- `calculateRealisticStepTarget` was capping recommendations at 5000 steps (50 min walk)
- `applyRealisticBounds` was limiting benefits to 15 min/day max
- This created confusing recommendations like "Walk 50 min to add 15 min" when user needed more

**Solution:**
- Remove all artificial caps - show the truth
- Calculate exact action needed to reach neutral (0 impact)
- Show the actual benefit of reaching neutral
- Format large walking times appropriately (e.g., "Walk 1h 45min")

**Example Fix:**
- Before: "Walk 50 minutes to add 15 min" (capped and misleading)
- After: "Walk 7,900 steps to add 1 hour 42 minutes" (truthful and motivating with actual step count needed)

**New Recommendation Principles:**
1. **Negative Metrics Priority**: The recommendation should always show the user how much they need to change their metric in order to achieve neutral time (0 impact)
2. **Positive Metrics Enhancement**: If there are no negative metrics to bring up to neutral, then the recommendation should take the lowest positive metric and tell the user how to add 20% to it

**Files Modified:**
- `Amped/Features/UI/RecommendationService.swift`: Removed caps, show true values

### Phase 1: Life Impact Scaling Logic Overhaul

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ **U-Shaped Compounding Bug** → ✅ Removed artificial amplification for daily periods in sleep calculations
- ❌ **Logarithmic Scaling Underestimation** → ✅ Fixed diminishing returns formula to maintain logical progression
- ❌ **Inconsistent Daily vs Monthly/Yearly Values** → ✅ Daily impacts no longer artificially inflated beyond true values
- ❌ **Missing Debug Visibility** → ✅ Comprehensive logging for all scaling calculations

**Technical Corrections:**
- **Sleep U-Shaped Effects**: Daily periods now return unmodified daily impact (no 25% amplification)
- **Exercise/Steps Logarithmic**: Monthly uses 85% of linear scaling, Yearly uses 65% (realistic diminishing returns)
- **Threshold Effects**: Daily periods get 30% of full effect (minimal but non-zero single-day impact)
- **Validation**: Added bounds checking and warnings for illogical scaling results

**Mathematical Progression Fixed:**
- Before: Day: -50 min, Month: -1,275 min, Year: -11,850 min (logical progression)
- After: Day: -50 min, Month: -1,275 min, Year: -11,850 min (logical progression)

**Files Modified:**
- `Amped/Features/LifeImpact/LifeImpactService.swift`: Core scaling logic fixes
- `.cursor/rules/lifespan-calculations.mdc`: Documentation updates

### "Today's Focus" Recommendations System Overhaul

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ **Hardcoded 20-minute walk recommendations** → ✅ Dynamic action sizing based on actual deficit
- ❌ **Mathematically impossible benefits** (20min walk → 36min life gain) → ✅ Realistic bounds checking (max 15min daily benefit from walking)
- ❌ **Inconsistent period scaling** (daily vs monthly vs yearly) → ✅ Proper period-appropriate calculations
- ❌ **Single action size for all users** → ✅ Personalized recommendations based on current fitness level

**Mathematical Corrections:**
- Daily view: Shows actual daily benefit achievable
- Monthly view: Shows monthly total if action sustained daily (dailyBenefit × 30)
- Yearly view: Shows yearly total if action sustained daily (dailyBenefit × 365)
- Bounds: Steps max 15min/day, Exercise max 20min/day, Sleep max 10min/day

**Files Modified:**
- `Amped/Features/UI/RecommendationService.swift`: Core recommendation logic
- `Amped/UI/Components/ActionableRecommendationsView.swift`: UI integration
- `.cursor/rules/lifespan-calculations.mdc`: Documentation updates

## Time Formatting Guidelines

### Display Rules
1. **Minutes (< 60)**: Display as "X minutes" (e.g., "45 minutes")
   - Singular: "1 minute"
   - Plural: "45 minutes"

2. **Hours (60+ minutes)**: Display as "X hours Y minutes" (e.g., "1 hour 19 minutes")
   - If exactly whole hours, display as "X hours" (e.g., "2 hours")
   - Singular hour: "1 hour 15 minutes"
   - Plural hours: "2 hours 30 minutes"

3. **Days (24+ hours)**: Display as "X.X days" with one decimal place (e.g., "2.5 days")
   - If exactly whole days, display as "X days" (e.g., "3 days")
   - Always use decimal notation for partial days

### Implementation
- Use the `formattedAsTime()` extension for full text display (e.g., "1 hour 19 minutes")
- Use the `formattedAsTimeShort()` extension for compact display (e.g., "1h 19m", "2.5d")
- This formatting applies to ALL time displays throughout the app
- Located in: `Amped/Core/Extensions/TimeFormattingExtensions.swift`

### Examples
- 79 minutes → "1 hour 19 minutes" (full) or "1h 19m" (short)
- 120 minutes → "2 hours" (full) or "2h" (short)
- 1500 minutes → "1 day 1 hour" (full) or "1.0d" (short)
- 3660 minutes → "2.5 days" (full) or "2.5d" (short)

### Special Case: Steps Recommendations
- **Steps metrics**: Show actual step count needed (e.g., "Walk 7,900 steps") instead of time
- **Other metrics**: Continue using time formatting (e.g., "Exercise 1 hour 30 minutes")
- **Benefits**: Always show time format for the benefit portion (e.g., "to add 1 hour 42 minutes")

### Recommendation Ending Format (Updated Phase 4)
- **All recommendations**: End with "to add X to your life" for clear benefit messaging
- **Daily recommendations**: Show additional amount needed (e.g., "Walk 4,143 more steps today to add 1 hour 42 minutes to your life")
- **Sleep daily recommendations**: Use "tonight" instead of "today" (e.g., "Sleep 1 hour more tonight to add 30 minutes to your life")
- **Month recommendations**: Show total daily target (e.g., "Walk 8,743 steps daily this month to add 30 hours to your life")
- **Year recommendations**: Show total daily target (e.g., "Walk 8,743 steps daily this next year to add 15.0 days to your life")
