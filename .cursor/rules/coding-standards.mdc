## Coding Standards

### Adhere to iOS Swift Modularization Guidelines

- Break app into small feature-focused modules instead of large ViewControllers
- **Keep all Swift files under 300 lines** with single responsibility per class/struct
- Separate business logic from UI using MVVM or Clean architecture patterns 
- Create independent modules for core services (networking, persistence, authentication)
- Use protocols to define clear interfaces between components
- Implement dependency injection to reduce coupling between modules
- Build reusable UI components in dedicated files
- Organize files in logical folder structures matching architectural layers
- Write isolated unit tests for each module to ensure independent functionality

### Swift Practices
- Prefer value types (structs) over reference types
- Use strong type safety and proper optionals handling
- Implement error handling with Result type and try/catch
- Follow Swift naming conventions
- Structure code for future team collaboration

### Documentation Practices
- Use /// comments for Swift DocC compatible documentation
- Include examples for non-obvious functionality
- Document internal decisions with comments when necessary
- Document all type and function parameters
- Use MARK comments to organize code sections
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### SwiftUI Patterns
- Use @State for local view state
- @StateObject for view model ownership
- @EnvironmentObject for shared dependencies
- Extract reusable components into separate views
- Use ViewBuilder for flexible view composition

### Architecture Guidelines
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Implement dependency injection for testability
- Use protocols for dependency abstraction
- Keep files under 300 lines with single responsibility
- Create clear module boundaries for future team scaling
