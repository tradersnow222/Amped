# Rules
- If a conflict arises, prioritize:
  1. **Security over performance**.
  2. **Correctness over speed**.
  3. **Readability over extreme optimization**.
  4. **User experience and scalability over implementation complexity** (unless performance is severely impacted).
  5. **Apple guidelines over any conflicting rule** in this document.
