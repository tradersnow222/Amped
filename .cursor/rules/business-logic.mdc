## Business Logic

### HealthKit Integration
- Request permissions for MVP core metrics only
- Fetch and monitor health data in real-time with background refresh
- Process raw data into usable metrics with appropriate units
- Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully with fallback mechanisms
- Implement efficient querying with appropriate limits for performance
- Support background task management for data synchronization

### Questionnaire Data Processing
- Store user-provided data securely on device
- Integrate manual inputs with HealthKit data for comprehensive analysis
- Use questionnaire data to fill gaps in HealthKit data
- Allow periodic re-prompting for updated information

### Life Impact Calculations
- Compare user metrics against scientific research baselines
- Calculate impact for each metric type using specialized algorithms
- Implement advanced scaling functions (linear, logarithmic, diminishing returns)
- Handle interaction effects between multiple health metrics
- Aggregate individual impacts into total lifespan effect
- Scale calculations based on selected time period (Day, Month, Year)
- Handle edge cases and data anomalies with robust error handling
- Incorporate both HealthKit and manual metrics in calculations
- Support meta-analysis synthesis for research-backed calculations

### Life Projection Calculations
- Calculate baseline life expectancy based on demographic information
- Adjust projection based on cumulative impact of health metrics
- Update projection as new data becomes available
- Present as both absolute value (years) and percentage (%)
- Include confidence interval in calculations

### Time Period Handling
- Support three primary periods (Day, Month, Year) for Life Impact Battery
- Apply appropriate scaling factors to calculations with effect type consideration
- Maintain historical data for trending with chart visualization support
- Implement caching for performance optimization
- Support real-time updates with background refresh

### User Engagement System
- Track user engagement streaks with milestone rewards
- Implement notification system for streak protection
- Provide personalized recommendations based on user data
- Support feature flags for gradual rollout of new capabilities
- Maintain offline operation with comprehensive caching strategy
