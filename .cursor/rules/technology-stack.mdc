- Swift Concurrency (async/await, Task) for performance
- OSLog for structured logging
- UserDefaults for settings persistence
- Sign in with Apple for authentication
- StoreKit for in-app purchases
- CloudKit (preparation for future sync capabilities)

### Dependencies
- Focus on native Apple frameworks, minimal third-party dependencies
- Any third-party libraries must have proven scalability to millions of users
