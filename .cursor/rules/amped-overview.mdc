# Project Specification: Amped iOS Health Metrics App (MVP)

## Overview
Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) iOS application named "Amped" with the tagline "Power Up Your Life" that integrates with Apple HealthKit to track and analyze health metrics in real-time. The app calculates time gained or lost based on scientific research and personal health data, presenting this information with a battery-themed interface that visualizes health as energy levels. This MVP must be designed with scalability in mind to support future growth to millions of users.
