## User Flow

### Onboarding Flow (Implementing "Little Yesses" Principle)
1. **Welcome Screen**: Initial engaging welcome with app logo and brand introduction
   - Visually appealing with battery-themed animation
   - Simple, engaging "Continue" or "Get Started" button (first small "yes")

2. **App Explainer & Personalization Intro**: Introduction to app and questionnaire
   - Battery icon at 50% charge with "Power Up Your Experience" text
   - 2-3 benefit icons with single-line descriptions (no paragraphs)
