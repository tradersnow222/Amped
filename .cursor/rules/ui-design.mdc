## UI Design

### Design System
- **Theme**: Battery-themed visuals with different energy/charge states
- **Colors**:
  - Base: ampedGreen (fully charged), ampedYellow (medium charge), ampedRed (low charge), ampedSilver, ampedDark
  - Energy levels: fullPower, highPower, mediumPower, lowPower, criticalPower
  - Time-based schemes: morning, midday, afternoon, evening, night
- **Typography**: System fonts with dynamic type support
- **Icons**: Battery icons following Apple's familiar design patterns (horizontal battery with segments)

### Key UI Components
- **BatteryLifeImpactCard**: Recent impact visualization with battery charge level
- **BatteryLifeProjectionCard**: Total projected life expectancy visualization
- **BatteryMetricCard**: Individual metric card with power level visualization
- **MetricDetailView**: Expanded view for single health metric
- **MetricChartSection**: Data visualization for metric history
- **MetricContextCard**: Contextual information about metrics
- **MetricTipCard**: Actionable tips for improving metrics

### Dual Battery Visualization System
- **Life Impact Battery**: Shows short-term health habit impacts
  - Visualizes recent changes from daily behaviors
  - Changes more dynamically based on recent activities
  - Time period selector limited to Day, Month, Year options
  - Changes feed into the overall Life Projection Battery

- **Life Projection Battery**: Shows total projected lifespan
  - Displayed as either “Total Life Energy Left" or "% Time Left to Live"
  - Based on baseline life expectancy plus cumulative impacts
  - More stable visualization that changes gradually over time, based on Life impact battery changes
  - Provides context for how daily habits affect long-term outcomes

### Animations
- Simple battery charging/discharging animations (optimized for performance)
- Energy flow animation between impact battery and projection battery
- Smooth transitions between app sections
- Minimal but effective animations for user engagement

### UX Principles
- Frictionless interactions with minimal taps to complete tasks
- Progressive disclosure of information (avoid overwhelming users)
- Consistent visual cues and feedback on all actions
- Optimize touch targets for easy interaction
- Minimize data input requirements where possible
- Use animations as functional indicators (not just decoration)
- Ensure all screens have clear next steps
- Design for interruption (users can leave and return easily)
- **Apply "Little Yesses" principle throughout the flow**
- User flow should give the feeling of “Making Progress” or “Moving forward” visually
